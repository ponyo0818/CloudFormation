#
When are CAPABILITIES_IAM/CAPABILITIES_NAMED_IAM Required

According to CloudFormation CreateStack Parameters, one of these is required when your Template includes any of the following o:

AWS::IAM::AccessKey
AWS::IAM::Group
AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile
AWS::IAM::Policy
AWS::IAM::Role
AWS::IAM::User
AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition 

1

You've added a resource of type AWS::IAM::Role to your resources section. This tells CloudFormation to create an IAM Role. In order to create IAM resources, you need to supply CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. It's an acknowledgement from you to CloudFormation that you understand that you are creating resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account.
